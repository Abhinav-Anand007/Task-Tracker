# React Task Tracker
1) Download the code as zip folder or clone it to a folder and extract it. <br>
2) In the extracted folder (Task-Tracker-main (by default)) open the terminal and run the following commands:
   a) npm install
   b) npm i @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
   c) npm start
3) Now the task tracker can be run on your system locally.   
4) Add tasks using submit button.
5) Click the task to mark it as completed. ( completed tasks are shown as strike-through text i.e. <s>example task</s> )
6) Tasks can be deleted via the delete button and edited via edit button.
7) Tasks can be reordered via drag-and-drop functionality.
8) Tasks can be filtered using the fiter option (all, completed and incomplete).
9) Local storage has also been implemented to persist tasks even when the page is refreshed.

Happy Tracking!
